specail comments: 
	in order to win you don't have to reach the victory cell in this game,
	because that cell is not on the board and therfor a car can't reach it.
	so alternetevlily, if a car reaches the cell so its end would be next to
	the victory cell (one more move and it would be on it), then you win.
